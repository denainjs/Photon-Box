# Photon-Box

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to **control the number of photons** inside a cavity. Atoms are repeatedly sent through the cavity, where they interact with the photons. Measuring their state gives some information on the cavity, and makes it possible to compute which control to apply. 

The math behind this and the different simulations we ran are both explained in the notebook ```PhotonBox.ipynb```.
