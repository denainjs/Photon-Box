    "\n",
    "Our goal is to stabilize the target Fock state $|n_{tag}\\rangle \\langle n_{tag}|$, for some target number of photons $n_{tag}$. A general method for choosing a control so as to stabilize a particular state, both in deterministic and stochastic systems, is to define a [Lyapunov function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function).\n",

    "Exhibiting a suitable Lyapunov function is useful prove that a given point is a stable equilibrium, but also to chose a control so that the system converges to this equilibrium, by picking at each step the value of the control that **minimizes the Lyapunov function**.\n",

    "By [LaSalle's first theorem theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaSalle%27s_invariance_principle), this would imply that for every trajectory, its accumulation points are zeros of $\\dot{V}$. Choosing $V$ astutely (for instance, such that $V(x)>0, \\text { for all } x \\neq 0$ and $V(0)=0$, following the hypotheses of LaSalle's second theorem) could therefore narrow down the set of possible stable accumulation points and ensure the stability of the origin $x^* = 0$.\n",
